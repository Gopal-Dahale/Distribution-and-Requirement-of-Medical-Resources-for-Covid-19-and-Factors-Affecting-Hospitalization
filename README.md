# Distribution and Requirement of Medical Resources for Covid 19 and Factors Affecting Hospitalization

## Motivation/Objective

- Manage limited resource during COVID-19
  - Predict admission to the ICU of confirmed cases.
    - Clinical spectrum of hospitalized patients (like respiratory rate, heart rate etc)
  - Analyse which clinical tests are indicative of hospitalisation of infected patients and/or requirement of ICU.
- Predict the number of people who'll get infected.
  - This was done using SIR/SEIR compartmental mathematical model.
- Estimating the percentage of hospitalized and infected people who may need ventilators or medical supervision.
